# Project 1: Google Data Analytics Capstone Project 

Used the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act to answer the questions listed in the PDF file.

- ASK:

In this phase I will be identifying the business task and considering key stakeholders. and I will be delivering you a clear statement of the business task.
The problem we are ,as a company, trying to solve is not consider a problem but a rather an enhancement to the company in which we are trying to increase the company’s net profit. Our director of marketing Moreno believes that by converting the casual riders to member riders will increase the company’s future success. So, the main point is to convince casual riders to purchase the annual membership. From here we will try to answer 3 questions Moreno assigned to us and they are :

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

To answer those question first we need to see the dataset we will be dealing with and try to organize, ensure credibility, who can access the data, verify the data integrity, see if this data can help me answer the question listed by Moreno, mention any problems with the data, how would it be stored, and a description of all the data sources used, all this will be answered in the next phase the Prepare Phase.
